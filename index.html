                        Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls
                        are scattered all over this planet; you just need to
                        know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest
                        Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there,
                        waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of
                        our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our
                        travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the
                        route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the
                        journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re
                        not into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of
                        lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll love, too.

                        Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for
                        about 20 years and there is no one else I would trust to
                        arrange my trips and tours. I've also had great fun on a
                        few of the group trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu
                        Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and diving.
                        It's always an eclectic group of well traveled,
                        interesting people.
